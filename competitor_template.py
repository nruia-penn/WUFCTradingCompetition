Boilerplate Competitor Class
----------------------------

Instructions for Participants:
1. Do not import external libraries beyond what's provided.
2. Focus on implementing the `strategy()` method with your trading logic.
3. Use the provided methods to interact with the exchange:
   - self.create_limit_order(price, size, side, symbol) -> order_id if succesfully placed in order book or None
   - self.create_market_order(size, side, symbol) -> order_id if succesfully placed in order book or None
   - self.remove_order(order_id, symbol) -> bool
   - self.get_order_book_snapshot(symbol) -> dict
   - self.get_balance() -> float
   - self.get_portfolio() -> dict

   
Happy Trading!

    An advanced adaptive rebalancing strategy that incorporates multiple statistical measures:

    1. For each symbol:
       - Get the order book snapshot and compute the mid-price.
       - Maintain a rolling history of mid-prices to compute volatility, Sharpe ratio, and a simple moving average (SMA).
       - Calculate percentage returns and use them to derive the Sharpe ratio.
       - Compute the SMA and the deviation of the current price from this average (a mean reversion indicator).
       - Calculate the order book imbalance to capture buying/selling pressure.
    2. Dynamically adjust order size based on volatility.
    3. Adjust limit order price offsets based on volatility.
    4. Incorporate inventory management: only trade if your current position deviates from the target (flat).
    5. Place orders based on combined signals (Sharpe ratio, imbalance, and mean reversion).
