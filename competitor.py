        An advanced adaptive rebalancing strategy that incorporates multiple statistical measures:

        1. For each symbol:
           - Get the order book snapshot and compute the mid-price.
           - Maintain a rolling history of mid-prices to compute volatility, Sharpe ratio, and a simple moving average (SMA).
           - Calculate percentage returns and use them to derive the Sharpe ratio.
           - Compute the SMA and the deviation of the current price from this average (a mean reversion indicator).
           - Calculate the order book imbalance to capture buying/selling pressure.
        2. Dynamically adjust order size based on volatility.
        3. Adjust limit order price offsets based on volatility.
        4. Incorporate inventory management: only trade if your current position deviates from the target (flat).
        5. Place orders based on combined signals (Sharpe ratio, imbalance, and mean reversion).
